Since May 19 2013, David El Achkar was logged every minute of his life. Whenever he completes a task, he logs that activity in his Google Calendar. He calls this project LifeLog

In December of 2013, he gave a talk detailing the experience of tracking his time as well as what insights he gained from it. Some of the insights he's gained include:

* Just over half his time is spent on basic survival activities (e.g., Sleep, Food, shower)
* he approximatley spends 30% of his time working

You should definitely checkout his video and his blog for more details on how someone else tracks and analyzes their time.
